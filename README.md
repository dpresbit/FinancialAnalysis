Using Python to analyze data from SEC filings

------

Tristan's Objectives:

In undertaking this project, I want to combine my interests in finance, data science, and 
web development to develop an application that will drive decision making for individuals 
in financial markets.

I plan on using Python to extract, process, and analyze data obtained from SEC EDGAR APIs. 
I would also like to include a variety of front end visualizations to portray analysis on 
individual stocks and to compare stocks.

TO START, I am going to work on creating a simple tool that can query EDGAR for a ticker 
and get the most recent 10-K form.
